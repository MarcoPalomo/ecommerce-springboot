#### Here's a brief explanation of each package:

* ``config``: Contains configuration classes, like SecurityConfig.java
* ``controller``: Contains REST controllers for handling HTTP requests
* ``model``: Contains entity classes that represent database tables
* ``repository``: Contains interfaces for database operations
* ``service``: Contains service classes that implement business logic

When adding new features or components to your e-commerce application, you'll typically create new classes in these respective packages. For example, if you were to add an Order feature, you might modify:

* ``Order.java`` in the model package
* ``OrderRepository.java`` in the repository package
* ``OrderService.java`` in the service package
* ``OrderController.java`` in the controller package
