/*
 Let's break down the components of this file:

The package statement declares the package in which this class resides.
The necessary Spring Boot import statements are included.
The @SpringBootApplication annotation is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:

@Configuration: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
@EnableAutoConfiguration: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.
@ComponentScan: Tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the com.monsite.ecommerce package, allowing it to find and register your controllers, services, etc.


The main method is the entry point of the Java application. It uses SpringApplication.run() to launch the application.

This file is crucial as it's the starting point of your Spring Boot application. When you run this class, it will start up the embedded server, set up the Spring application context, and initialize all the components we've created (controllers, services, repositories, etc.).
You don't need to modify this file unless you want to add some custom configuration or beans at the application level. For most purposes, including the e-commerce website we're building, this default setup is sufficient.
Is there anything specific about the EcommerceApplication.java file or the application startup process you'd like me to explain further?
